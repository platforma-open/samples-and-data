Fix runtime `Permission denied` when the parse-seurat container runs as a non-root UID (MILAB-6263). The entrypoint re-invoked `renv::restore()` on every start, which tries to reconcile the system R library at `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/` with the project lockfile. When the `r-base:4.4.2` base image preinstalled a version of a locked package (e.g. `rlang`) that differs from `renv.lock`, renv attempted to back up the system-library copy before replacing it — failing on hosts that run the container unprivileged. renv now installs into a project-local library at `/app/renv/library` and `R_LIBS_USER` points R at the same path, so the obsolete `/app/run.sh` wrapper and runtime restore are removed.
